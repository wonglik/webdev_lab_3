                    <h2>Vacation in Mersing, Johor: Bonding Beyond the Classroom</h2>
                    <p>Our trip to Mersing, Johor, was one of the best experiences I’ve shared with my coursemates. Away
                        from lectures and assignments, we had a chance to unwind together, exploring beautiful beaches,
                        enjoying local cuisine, and taking in the peaceful vibes of Mersing. Whether we were relaxing by
                        the sea or laughing over dinner, the trip allowed us to connect on a deeper level, creating
                        friendships and memories that will stay with us long after university life. This vacation wasn’t
                        just a break; it was a bonding experience that reminded me how important it is to create moments
                        beyond our academic lives.</p>

                    <h2>Foreign Language Festival Week: Embracing the French Culture</h2>
                    <p>Participating in the Foreign Language Festival Week was an exciting way to celebrate my journey
                        in
                        learning French. The event brought together students from various language backgrounds, each
                        eager to showcase their language skills and cultural insights. As a French learner, I joined
                        activities that ranged from speaking competitions to cultural exhibits, all of which allowed me
                        to dive deeper into the language and the vibrant French culture. The festival was both
                        challenging and fun, pushing me to practice my French in new ways while connecting with others
                        who shared a passion for languages. </p>
